## Warehouse backend simulation using -> Java Spring Boot + PostGresQl Database + RabbitMQ

# 📦 Warehouse Backend Simulation  

This project is a **backend simulation of a warehouse** that processes materials through a connected web interface.  

## Features  

🏗️ **Storage logic**  
  Materials are stored based on their **weight** and **type**.  

⏳ **Time-based pricing**  
  Storage costs are dynamically calculated depending on how long materials remain in the warehouse.  

🌐 **Web interface integration**  
  The backend integrates with a web interface, allowing users to easily place a storing order if there is available space in the warehouse.
